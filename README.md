# Feed-reader testing

Practice writing unit tests for a simple feed-reader webapp. Completed as a student project for [Udacity's Front-End Development Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).

## How to run
Download the repo, or clone with:

`$ git clone https://github.com/dinakonto/feed-reader-testing.git`

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the webapp.
Jasmine test readouts will be printed at the bottom of the page.

All test code can be found in `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`

üçªCheers!
